Getting Started
===============

Please note that we currently only have documentation for C#. VB support has been minimally tested, but it should work. A basic IterativeRobot template is currently included in the extension to get started.

Online Installation
======================

RobotDotNet can be compiled using Mono on Linux and Mac OSX, but is currently best supported using Windows and Visual Studio. Here's how to get started.

Open Visual Studio, Go to Tools | Extensions and Updates. Then select Online and search for "FRC Extension". Click download on the FRC Extension. 

If your RoboRIO has not been setup for RobotDotNet yet, please see SetupRIO for provisioning instructions. Also please make sure to set your Team Number, by going to FRC | Team Number in Visual Studio after installing the Extension.

Now that your RoboRIO has been setup, and the FRC extensions have been installed into Visual Studio, you are now ready to create some code and upload it to the robot. Please see our Programmer's Guide for instructions on this.


Manual Installation
===================

If you do not have an active internet connection on your dev system, you can download an offline version of the FRC Extensions `here <>`.


Run the MSI installer, which will install the FRC Extension to Visual Studio, and also place the current versions of the RoboRIO tools into the correct folder.

If your RoboRIO has not been setup for RobotDotNet yet, please see SetupRIO for provisioning instructions.

Now that your RoboRIO has been setup, and the FRC extensions have been installed into Visual Studio, you are now ready to create some code and upload it to the robot. Please see our Programmer's Guide for instructions on this.


Upgrading the Extension
=======================

If your developer system is connected to the internet, you can install updates to the extention using the Tools | Extensions and Updates utility. If updates are available, they will show up in the Updates section.

If your developer system is not connected to the internet, you can download the offline version of the installer and run it. That will update the extentions and tools to the latest version.
